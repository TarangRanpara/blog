Hi 👋, Namaste 🙏, Hello World 🌎!!

I'm [Tarang](/About/me), and I welcome you to my humble abode on the vast internet. Once upon a time, I thought I'd call this space "Engineer's Guide to Life" - a bold attempt to present a manual of sorts, to connect the dots between code and existence. But then, a thought struck me: who am I kidding? Life, much like code, is messy, unpredictable, and constantly refactored. 

Also, an inspiration struck from the age-old wisdom: 

> Real knowledge lies in knowing that ones knows nothing

I.e., The more I learn, the more I realize how little I actually know. What I have is not a grand guide, but fragments - "bits" of knowledge, "pieces" of experience. And thus, "Bits and Pieces" was born. It’s not the whole truth, but maybe just enough to compile into something meaningful.

I hope that this site serves the following purposes (optimistically speaking): 
1. As a place to share things or two about my work and education (i.e. A good old portfolio website), including but not limited to the following: 
    - Interesting courses I went through and key takeaways
    - Projects/Thesis done as part of coursework at the Uni.
    - My side projects and experiments (including failed ones)
    - Interesting projects that I'm involved in at work.
2. As a place to share my notes on Computer Science, Mathematics, and Machine Learning (Or AI as they like to call it nowadays). 
3. As a place to share my thoughts on topics ranging from Philosophy, Religion (No extremist views, by the way), Spirituality, and Life. 

As Richard Stallman once said: 
> Sharing knowledge is the most fundamental act of friendship. 
> Because it is a way you can give something without losing something.

I created this website to with the same ethos. I chose to self-host it because I believe information should not be bound by the rules of commercial platforms. Knowledge belongs to everyone — it should be accessible, open, and independent. Here, you won't find ads, trackers, or corporate influence — only the sincere attempt to share something real and unfiltered.

Thanks for stopping by!
