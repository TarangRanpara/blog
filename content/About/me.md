## 1. Intro

Namaste, Hello, Hola, I'm **Tarang Ranpara!** ðŸ‘‹

Originally from the beautiful city of Rajkot, Gujarat, India, I now reside in Bangalore, where I continue my professional journey in the world of technology. I currently work with the MySQL Group at Oracle, contributing to one of the most popular open source database product. I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Machine Learning, which fuels my passion for exploring the intersection of data, intelligence, and innovation. Curiosity drives me â€” whether it's diving deep into new technologies, understanding complex systems, or simply learning something new every day.

In Albert Einstein's words: 

> The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence.

If there's a thread running through my life, it's curiosity â€” relentless, untamed, ever-burning. It all began with the big questions of physics: "How did it all come about?" "Why are things the way they are?" "Where are we headed?" But the deeper I looked, the wider my curiosity grew â€” pulling me into the mysteries of life, philosophy, and the human experience itself. Pursuing a degree in Computer Science gave my questions a new direction: "How do computers work?" "How do machines learn?" "Can we teach machines to think?", and countless other questions about the world around us.

Every new piece of knowledge feels like connecting another dot in a vast, ever-expanding picture. Learning isnâ€™t just something I do; itâ€™s the journey I've always been on. And the adventure is far from over.

## 2. Work Experience

### Member Technical Staff @ Oracle, Bengaluru, India
> Aug 2022 - Present

#### Jan 2023 - Present

I am currently part of `MySQL Runtime` Engineering team of `MySQL Engineering Group`, where I work on solving interesting problems related to database internals. Some of my contributions to the open-source version of the MySQL Server can be found here: [Tarang's commits for MySQL Community version](https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server/commits?author=tranpara).

Articles discussing my work can be found here: [Tarang's Articles](https://blogs.oracle.com/authors/tarang-ranpara)

Tools used: `C/C++`, `Bash`, `CMake`, `GDB`, `Pthreads`, `YACC`, `MySQL`

#### Aug 2022 - Dec 2023

I was part of the MySQL Runtime Engineering team within the MySQL Engineering Group, where I worked on both the control plane and data plane of [Heatwave MySQL](https://www.oracle.com/heatwave/), a fully managed "MySQL as a Service" offering on OCI.

Tools used: `Java`, `Python`, `Maven`, `Dropwizard`

### Researcher @ IR Lab, DAU (Erstwhile DA-IICT), Gandhinagar, India
> Jul 2021 - Jul 2022

Pursued my 1-year master's thesis titled "Finding Proxy For Human Evaluation: Re-evaluating the evaluation of news summarization" under the guidance of Prof. Prasenjit Majumder. 

The thesis explores various evaluation metrics including the defacto metric, ROUGE, and various contextual similarity models like BERT ROBERTA, word2vec, etc. and it proves that the defacto evaluation metric ROUGE performs worse than various contextual similarity-based metrics. The idea is that a metric having a higher correlation with human evaluation is said to be a better proxy of it, and hence a better metric.

My Thesis can be found at: [Tarang's Thesis](   https://drsr.daiict.ac.in/handle/123456789/1122)

### SDE Intern @ OpsHub, Ahmedabad, India
> May 2021 - Jul 2021

Built a silent installation utility for OIM (OpsHub Integration Manager), which aids the installation of OIM through CLI.

### Graduate Teaching Assistent @ DAU (Erstwhile DA-IICT), Gandhinagar, India
> Aug 2020 - Jul 2022

Led labs and tutorials for the following courses:

#### IT214 - "Database Management Systems" under Prof. Minal Bhise
Responsibilities Included conducting labs and tutorials about ER Modeling, ER to Relational Model conversion, Database Design (DDL), Database Normalisation, and SQL Queries (Using Postgresql)

#### IT115 - "Introduction to programming" under Prof. Manish Khare
Responsibilities Included conducting labs and tutorials about introduction to various programming constructs using C/C++ language. 
 
#### IT618 - "Enterprise Computing" under Prof. PM Jat
Responsibilities Included conducting labs and tutorials about java, back-end architecture, and frameworks like Spring, and Hibernate. 

#### IT457 - "Cloud Computing" under Prof. Lavneet Singh 
Responsibilities Included conducting labs and tutorials about Cloud computing and various services of AWS for performing various tasks including load balancing, database services, storage services, caching services etc.

### Researcher @ Space Applications Centre, ISRO, Ahmedabad, India
> Jan 2020 - May 2020

Worked on building a data processing tool for signal data. The tool utilized many math-intensive functionalities which required us to use NumPy stack heavily. For parallelization purposes, we used Numba for its easy-to-use APIs for JIT compiler and threading (both CPU and GPU).

## 4. Projects

### SignY - Indian Sign Language Intepretation using Deep Learning

Developed a system to translate Indian Sign Language (ISL) alphabets into verbal English. Achieved translation of all 26 alphabets using a custom-built dataset. Implemented core functionality with YOLO v3, Python 3, and OpenCV. Final deployment was completed as a web application with Flask as the back-end framework. A basic version of the project was also presented at vesAIthon 2019, a national-level AI hackathon.

## 5. Achievements

### Gold medal in INSEF Fair (by Science Society Of India) - 2019 
Project: Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
Developed machine learning models for heart disease prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to compare performance. The models were deployed as REST APIs, enabling integration with any host mobile or web application. Additionally, a client application was designed for Android to allow remote access to the service.
The project was awarded the Gold Medal for excellence.
